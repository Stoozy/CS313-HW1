Containers Chosen: Vector, List, Array

These three containers, all take linear time to finish.

In a list, you need extra space for pointers, however in a vector and in an array you don't so the update is much faster.

My Hypothesis: I think the array will be faster than both the vector and the list.

The Results: The 3 containers: Vector, List, and Array are the same time.
Explanation: Even though, the array is faster to acces and the update of both the array and vector is faster than the list, they all run on linear time.
