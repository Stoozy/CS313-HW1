Unsorted 2D structure is: 

99 49 72 87 24 
52 27 22 67 11 
15 87 53 100 55 
47 29 99 91 72 
36 55 69 88 44 

Sorted 2D structure is: 

11 15 22 24 27 
29 36 44 47 49 
52 53 55 55 67 
69 72 72 87 87 
88 91 99 99 100 


Problem 3. Create a sort for 2d matrices. Do a bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort variation of this. Do NOT convert the matrix into a 1D array to sort. You must sort it as a 2D structure.
  In this question I created a matrix that worked just like a 2d array and declaring two variables that have been swapped. Once this is done a search method for bubble sort. In this method the adjacent elements in this array are swapped if they are not the correct order. After this search method is complete, I had made selection sort to find the smallest number and place it at the beginning of my array. The last search is the insertion sort which compares each element in the array to a spot suitable for it.  
  Next is the main part of the program which uses all the functions created before. This is where I created a 2d random array and printed it on to the console. Then I used the bubble sort method, selection sort method, and lastly the insertion sort method to have the array sorted row by row.
